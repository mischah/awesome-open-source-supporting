## Foundations

### JS Foundation

The [JS Foundation](https://js.foundation/) supports some of the most important projects in the JavaScript ecosystem (ESLint, Lodash, Moment, webpack [among others](https://js.foundation/community/projects)). 

The foundation is financed entirely by its members and the donations and contributions from the JavaScript community.

Info about how to donate can be found [over here](https://js.foundation/about/donate).
